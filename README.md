# runemate-bot-api
Shared RuneMate API

### Description
[RuneMate](https://www.runemate.com/community/) is a botting client for the MMORPG RuneScape. It provides a platform with APIs for developers to retrieve data from the game client to evaluate and make decisions what inputs to send back to the game, resulting in automating aspects of the game.

The classes in this repository were collaborately developed by a handful of bot developers to complement RuneMate's official API with helpful frameworks and higher level APIs, as well as a reusable JavaFX UI framework to display settings and runtime statistics of individual bots.

### Publication
The code in this repository is long past its development phase and might not compile against recent versions of RuneMate. In the meantime newer and higher quality repositories similar to this were founded which remain private, this one however is being made public as guidance and reference for newcomers to RuneMate.
